⭐ If you find this project helpful, don't forget to give it a star on GitHub!

This README is **project-specific**, clean, and perfect for a GitHub portfolio.  
It explains **what the project does, how to run it, and what technologies are used**, plus future improvements to show recruiters you think ahead.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **.gitignore** file specifically for Java projects (so your `build/`, `dist/`, and IDE files don’t get uploaded)?
